# Installing <latex/>

The process and software choices for installing <latex/> vary by
platform, so choose your platform to find out how to install.

* [Windows](./install.md#windows)
* [Mac OS](./install.md#mac-os) 
* [Linux](./install.md#linux)
* [Online](./install.md#online)

In general for each system a distribution of <latex/> is installed together with
an editor or development environment to make life a little easier.

The most beginner friendly option for any platform is the editor
[LyX](https://www.lyx.org/), which presents an interface more like a standard
word processor. If you decide to use LyX, you need to install a <latex/>
distribution first.

## Windows

For Windows the standard distribution is [MikTex](https://miktex.org/).

Here is a video explaining the installation process for Window.

available for Windows.

## Mac OS

For Mac OS, the standard installation is [MacTex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/), 
this bundles the MacTex distrinbution together with the TeXShop editor and some
other utilities. One install file is all you need.

Download the [installer](https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) to get
started.

## Linux

For Linux, TexLive is the standard distribution, with several different <latex/>
specific editors and IDEs available.

For any Debian or Redhat derived system, installation is a simple terminal 
command.

```bash
sudo [apt|yum] install texlive
```

To write <latex/> documents you can use any editor or IDE, you may already be a vim
or emacs fan in which case stick with what you know. Here are some alternative
editors you may want to try.

* [Texstudio](https://www.texstudio.org/)
* [Gummi](https://github.com/alexandervdm/gummi)

## Online

Using an online service simplifies much of the process, as there's no need to install
anything.

[Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), is one of the main online <latex/> services.
It is primariy a paid service, but a free tier is available which lacks the
collaborative features of the paid service.
