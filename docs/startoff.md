# Getting Started

## Introduction

Welcome to <latex/> 101!

Whether you have just heard about <latex/> <LaTex/> or have already started out
on a journey of learning this is the place to be!

<latex/> is a document preparation macro language based on the original <TeX/> language
created by Computing Science legend [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth)
in 1978.

If you've ever looked at a Computing or Mathematical Science research paper then there's a
very good chance it was prepared in <latex/>!

## How it Works

Unlike preparing a document in word processing software such as MS Word or LibreOffice Writer,
documents in <latex/> are prepared as plain text files, and then processed to produce an output
file (typically a PDF).

This means that a shift in mindset is needed when moving to using <latex/>, instead of the
usual paradigm of WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get), where a document is prepared in a 
word processor and the on screen display matches the final output we move to WYMIWYG (what you mean
is what you get) where we 'markup' the document with instructions about layout and focus mainly 
on the content.
